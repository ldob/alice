# ALICE

ALICE is a serious game prototype, developed as part of my master's thesis at Vienna University of Technology. 

According to the WHO "exercising regularly" and "eating healthily" are two of the most important factors for prevention of 
numerous diseases. Serious Games can help promote a healthy lifestyle by supporting these preventive measures. Therefore a 
prototype of a user-centered Serious Game is designed and implemented, which creates awareness of healthy nutrition and 
increases the motivation for physical activity at the same time. Evaluations show an improvement of the test subjects in both areas.

More details can be found in my [Master's Thesis](TODO)
